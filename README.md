# 📊 BI as Code: Marketing Analytics with Evidence.dev

Interactive marketing dashboards built entirely with SQL and Markdown — powered by **dbt** + **PostgreSQL** + **Evidence.dev**.

A BI-as-Code stack that:
- Seeds synthetic marketing data from a public S3 bucket into PostgreSQL using DuckDB
- Runs dbt transformations (staging → intermediate → marts)
- Serves interactive dashboards through Evidence.dev — just SQL queries inside Markdown files
- Runs locally with Docker Compose, no cloud accounts needed

## 🙋🏻‍♂️ Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop
- Node.js 18+

## 📝 Steps

### 1. Start database, seed data and run dbt

```bash
docker compose up
```

This starts:
- PostgreSQL with ~400K rows from S3
- dbt (17 analytics models)
- Evidence.dev-ready data in `marketing` schema

### 2. Configure Evidence connection (one-time setup)

```bash
cp reports/sources/marketing/connection.yaml.example reports/sources/marketing/connection.yaml
```

The default values match the Docker Compose setup:

```yaml
name: marketing
type: postgres
options:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  user: postgres
  password: postgres
  database: marketing
```

### 3. Start the dashboard

On another terminal, run:

```bash
cd reports && npm install && npm run sources && npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000
