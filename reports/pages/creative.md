# Ad Performance by Creative Type

<Details title="About this heatmap">

This heatmap shows the cross-dimensional performance of different creative types (image, video, carousel, etc.) across various platforms (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, etc.). The color intensity represents total conversions, allowing you to identify which creative formats work best on each platform. This insight helps optimize your creative strategy and budget allocation across platforms.

```sql creative_platform_performance
SELECT
    COALESCE(creative_type, 'Unknown') as creative_type,
    COALESCE(platform, 'Unknown') as platform,
    SUM(COALESCE(conversions, 0)) as total_conversions
FROM int_ads
WHERE conversions > 0
GROUP BY creative_type, platform
HAVING SUM(conversions) > 0
ORDER BY total_conversions DESC
```
